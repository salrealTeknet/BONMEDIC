fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/salrealTeknet/BONMEDIC.git/': OpenSSL SSL_connect: Connection was reset 
in connection to github.com:443
ChatGPT

This error typically occurs due to issues with your network connection, SSL/TLS configuration, or Git settings. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:
1. Check Network Connection

Ensure your internet connection is stable and not being interrupted.
2. Update Git

Make sure you are using the latest version of Git. You can update Git using the following commands based on your operating system:

    Windows:
        Download and install the latest Git from git-scm.com.
    macOS:
        Use Homebrew:

        sh

    brew update
    brew upgrade git

Linux:

    Use your package manager, for example:

    sh

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get upgrade git

3. Configure SSL Verification

Try disabling SSL verification to see if it resolves the issue. Note that this is not recommended for long-term use as it reduces security.

sh

git config --global http.sslVerify false

4. Check SSL/TLS Configuration

Ensure that your system’s SSL/TLS libraries are up to date. You can try updating OpenSSL:

    Ubuntu/Debian:

    sh

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade openssl

5. Clear Git Cache

Clear Git’s credentials cache to force a re-authentication:

sh

git credential-cache exit

6. Use SSH Instead of HTTPS

Consider using SSH to clone the repository instead of HTTPS. Set up SSH keys with GitHub by following GitHub's guide.

sh

git@github.com:salrealTeknet/BONMEDIC.git

7. Check Firewall and Proxy Settings

If you're behind a firewall or using a proxy, you may need to configure Git to use the proxy:

sh

git config --global http.proxy http://proxyuser:proxypassword@proxy.server.com:port
git config --global https.proxy https://proxyuser:proxypassword@proxy.server.com:port

8. Restart Your System

Sometimes a simple restart can resolve network and configuration issues.

By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the issue preventing you from accessing the GitHub repository. If the problem persists, please provide more details about your environment (OS, Git version, etc.) for further assistance.
in django which of the folders contain settings
ChatGPT

In a Django project, the settings for the project are typically found in the settings.py file within the main project directory. This directory is the one that contains manage.py. Here's an example of the typical structure of a Django project:

markdown

myproject/
    manage.py
    myproject/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py

In this example, settings.py is located inside the myproject directory. This file contains all the configuration settings for your Django project, such as database configurations, installed apps, middleware, and other settings.

If you're using a more complex setup, such as having separate settings for different environments (development, production, etc.), you might see a structure like this:

csharp

myproject/
    manage.py
    myproject/
        __init__.py
        settings/
            __init__.py
            base.py
            development.py
            production.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py

In this case, the settings are split into multiple files within the settings directory, with base.py containing the common settings and development.py and production.py containing environment-specific settings. The __init__.py file in the settings directory allows you to treat the directory as a module.

You can refer to specific settings files in your manage.py or wsgi.py by setting the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable. For example:

python

os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'myproject.settings.development')

This tells Django to use the development.py settings file.
i tried deploying on vercel and i got this error The specified Root Directory "inventory-management-master" does not exist. Please update your Project Settings.
ChatGPT

The error message "The specified Root Directory 'inventory-management-master' does not exist" indicates that Vercel cannot find the directory you've specified as the root for your project. This is usually due to a misconfiguration in your project settings on Vercel.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:
Step 1: Verify Your Project Structure

Ensure that your project structure matches what you have specified in Vercel. Your project directory should look something like this:

markdown

inventory-management-master/
    manage.py
    inventory_management/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
    ...

Step 2: Correct the Root Directory in Vercel Settings

    Log in to Vercel: Go to Vercel Dashboard and log in to your account.
    Select Your Project: Click on your project from the dashboard.
    Go to Settings: Navigate to the "Settings" tab of your project.
    Find Root Directory Setting: Look for the "Root Directory" setting.
    Update Root Directory: Ensure that the root directory is set to the correct path. For example, if your manage.py file is directly under inventory-management-master, set the root directory to /.

Step 3: Ensure the Correct Build and Output Settings

    Build Command: Ensure the build command is set correctly. For Django, you might not need a build command, but if you are using any frontend frameworks (e.g., React for the frontend), ensure the correct build command is specified.
    Output Directory: Set the output directory to where your build files are generated, if applicable.

Step 4: Check Your vercel.json Configuration (Optional)

If you are using a vercel.json file for configuration, ensure it is set up correctly. Here is an example configuration for a Django project:

json

{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "inventory_management/wsgi.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python",
      "config": { "maxLambdaSize": "15mb" }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "inventory_management/wsgi.py"
    }
  ]
}

Step 5: Re-deploy Your Project

After making these changes, try redeploying your project on Vercel.
Additional Tips

    Check Directory Names: Ensure there are no typos in directory names.
    Local Deployment: Try running your Django project locally to ensure there are no errors before deploying.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the "Root Directory does not exist" error and successfully deploy your Django project on Vercel.

ChatGPT

The error you're encountering suggests that there's an issue with building the typed-ast package, which is a dependency listed in your requirements.txt. This can happen due to various reasons such as missing build dependencies, incompatible Python version, or issues with the package itself.

Here are steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:
Step 1: Check and Update requirements.txt

Ensure that your requirements.txt file is up to date and does not contain any unnecessary or outdated dependencies. If you don't specifically need typed-ast, consider removing it.
Step 2: Install Build Tools

Ensure that the necessary build tools are available. This often includes gcc, make, and python3-dev (or the equivalent for your Python version).

For local development, you can install these tools using:

    Ubuntu/Debian:

    sh

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential python3-dev

macOS:

sh

    xcode-select --install

Step 3: Add Precompiled Wheels

If certain packages are failing to build from source, you can try installing them as precompiled wheels. Add the following to your requirements.txt:

text

--use-feature=2020-resolver
--find-links https://download.lfd.uci.edu/pythonlibs/typed_ast/
typed-ast

Step 4: Modify the vercel.json Configuration (Optional)

Modify your vercel.json to specify a different Python version if necessary or to include additional build steps. Here is an example:

json

{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "inventory_management/wsgi.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python",
      "config": {
        "runtime": "python3.10",
        "maxLambdaSize": "15mb"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "inventory_management/wsgi.py"
    }
  ]
}

Step 5: Use a Custom Build Step

If the default Vercel build process doesn't work, you might need to create a custom build step. For instance, you can use a build.sh script to handle the installation of dependencies.

Create a build.sh file in the root of your project with the following content:

sh

#!/bin/bash

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade setuptools
pip install --upgrade wheel

pip install --target . -r requirements.txt

Then, modify your vercel.json to use this custom build step:

json

{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "build.sh",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "."
      }
    },
    {
      "src": "BONMEDIC/wsgi.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "BONMEDIC/wsgi.py"
    }
  ]
}
